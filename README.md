Qzone Crawler
=============

The first 14 commits are managed by SVN, which are created during my last summer of the student life. They scratch different kinds of datas from [Qzone](http://qzone.qq.com/), and save into the local SQLite database.

Now I migrate the project to Git, and hope rewrite it with Object-Oriented thinking. If possible, I will add GUI to make it more like an application.
